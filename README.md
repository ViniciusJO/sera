# SERA - asm HTTP server

Studying [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) and [fasm](https://flatassembler.net/) writing a simple http server.

I love to write `fasm`, it's fun and ergonomic (as far as assemblers can go), but its a nightmare to debbug in linux. Its oficial tooling is develop to window and integrate it with gdb is a unsolved computation problem.

`nasm`, in other hand, feels janky, but works flawlessly with the linux ecosystem. It seems more complete and robust, which implies an enormous complexity.

In conclusion I'll sadly not touch `fasm` again untill better tooling in linux and will need to speend some time unweaving the `nasm`'s nest.
